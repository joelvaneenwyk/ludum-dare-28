Ludum Dare 28: One Shot
=======================

![alt text](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/ld28MenuOne.png "Project Anarchy")

First [Ludum Dare][1] that Ryan Monday and I have ever participated in and we used [Project Anarchy][2]. The theme for this one was **One Shot**. So we made a simple top-down 3D shooter where you only have one missile to destroy all the asteroids in the arena. The catch is the missile has a shell life based off bounces, so you have to aim your shot carefully. If you complete the mission then you will move on to the next round. See how many rounds you can complete! We also made a [blog post][3] about it, so go check that out for more information on our process.

### Controls

- ENTER - Start the Game
- W,A,D - Move the player
- R - Reset the game
- SPACE - Shoot your one missile

### Scene

To play the game in vForge, you don't need to compile any custom code. The source code is just there for when we packaged up an executable build for distribution. Open up `project\Scenes\main.scene` in vForge to play the game!
