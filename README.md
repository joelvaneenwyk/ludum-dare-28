Ludum Dare 28: One Shot
=======================

First Ludum Dare that Ryan Monday and I have ever participated in. The theme for this one was **One Shot**. So
we made a simple top-down 3D shooter where you only have one missile and it bounces aruond to destroy all the
asteroids on screen.Sample pinball game using Project Anarchy!
